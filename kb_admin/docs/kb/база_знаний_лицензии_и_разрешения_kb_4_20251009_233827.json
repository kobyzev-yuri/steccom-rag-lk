Introduction 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this manual is to provide the information required to enable the end user, customer and installer to successfully install the Z12Mk2 antenna and controller and to program the KA-160 for operation. It is recommended that all personnel operating the Z12Mk2 systems know which type of system they are dealing with, read and understand the basic terms, and are fully familiar with the operation of these systems. Although installation may be completed by personnel preferred or designated by the customer, it is also recommended that personnel be trained in the KNS for more suitable equipment installation procedures, and trained by KNS Inc. experts in the relevant matters. Section 2 of this document has been provided to ensure that ALL personnel are aware of the specific safety hazards involved in the installation and configuration of the KNS equipment (e.g. electrical, static and RF radiation hazards). 2 2. Personnel and Antenna This section defines the areas near or within the radiation area of the auto acquire antennas currently deployed. It is recommended that ALL customers operating this equipment become familiar with the radiation patterns of these units and strictly adhere to the precautions outlined below. 2.1 Radiation Limits Radiation limits are defined in terms of maximum permissible exposure (MPE), a frequency-dependent level of radiation to which a person is subjected over some duration of time. Besides being frequency-dependent, the MPE level and duration of time based on the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of the human body depends on whether the area around the antenna is controlled or uncontrolled. The definitions of these two types of areas are quoted from OET 65, as follows: \\u201cThe FCC guidelines incorporate two separate tiers of exposure limits that are dependent on the situation in which the exposure takes place and/or the status of the individuals who are subject to exposure. The decision as to which tier applies in a given situation should be based on the application of the following definitions. Occupational/controlled exposure limits apply to situations in which persons are exposed as a consequence of their employment and in which those persons who are exposed have been made fully aware of the potential for exposure and can exercise control over their exposure. Occupational/controlled exposure limits also apply where exposure is of a transient nature as a result of incidental passage through a location where exposure levels may be above general population/uncontrolled limits (see below), as long as the exposed person has been made fully aware of the potential for exposure and can exercise control over his or her exposure by leaving the area or by some other appropriate means. As discussed later, the occupational/controlled exposure limits also apply to amateur radio operators and members of their immediate household. General population/uncontrolled exposure limits apply to situations in which the general public may be exposed or in which persons who are exposed as a consequence of their employment may not be made fully aware of the potential for exposure or cannot exercise control over their exposure. Therefore, members of the general public would always be considered under this category when exposure is not employment-related, for example, in the case of a telecommunications tower to which persons in a nearby residential area are exposed. 3 For the purpose of applying these definitions, awareness of the potential for RF exposure in a workplace or similar environment can be provided through specific training as part of an RF safety program. Warning signs and labels can also be used to establish such awareness as long as they provide information, in a prominent manner, on the risk of potential exposure and instructions on the methods of minimizing such a risk of exposure.\\u201d The following conclusions can be drawn from these tables (Figure 2-1): Power density between the feed flange and reflector is at a hazardous level and access to this area must be prevented while the terminal is transmitting. Under no circumstances should any part of a person\\u2019s body be placed in this region while the terminal is transmitting. Based on a controlled-area power density of 5 mW/cm2 over any 6-minute period, in some cases less than 14.6 seconds of exposure is allowable in this region. Note that, in general, an operator would not be manually adjusting the feed during a high-rate, high- power transmission. Also note that the power density decreases toward the reflector (as the beam widens from the feed), so the maximum exposure time increases as the distance from the feed increases. Near-field levels of radiation are below the controlled-area requirement, but in some cases are above the uncontrolled area requirement. Although the nature of transmissions is such that radiated power levels should not reach full power at any time, there is no absolute guarantee of reduced transmission levels; therefore, access to the near field of the antenna must also be restricted. Since the near field is contained within a cylinder pointed from the reflector toward the satellite, we can compute the horizontal distance from the front of the reflector to which access must be restricted. Table 2-1 computes this distance. At distances in excess of the tabulated limits, access can be unrestricted. Between the antenna and the tabulated limits, access should be limited to less than 10 minutes in any 30-minute interval. Far-field levels of radiation are below the uncontrolled-area requirement and are therefore not a concern. 4 Feed Horn Hazard Area Warning Area Figure 2-1 Defined Radiation Areas Hazard Area (Between the feed and reflector): This is the highest power density region because the area of power radiation (the feed flange) is smallest. Warning Area (Near field): This is the area bounded by a cylinder within the same diameter of the reflector, and which extends from the reflector toward the satellite for, in the case of auto acquire systems, less than 75 meters (the exact distance depends on frequency and the diameter of the reflector). Far field: This is the area situated at some distance from the antenna, where the radiation density falls off with the square of distance. 5 2.2 Recommendations Access to the immediate vicinity of the antenna (reflector and feed) must be restricted to trained customers and certified contracted/service personnel. No member of personnel should interpose any of their body parts between the feed and the reflector while the terminal is transmitting. At full output power, this region is dangerous in cases of exposure of more than about 14.6 seconds. At full output power, the near-field output of the auto acquire terminals exceeds the allowable levels for continuous exposure in an uncontrolled area. This near field is a cylindrical region which encloses the reflector and points toward the satellite. Because many sites accommodating the auto acquire terminals are accessible to non-operational personnel, these sites should be considered as uncontrolled and the recommended precautions taken accordingly. The primary precaution should consist in restricting access to the immediate area in front of the reflector to short durations, which, according to worst-case assumptions, means that access should be limited to less than 10 minutes within any 30-minute interval. If limited-duration access cannot be insured, then no access should be allowed within the distances specified in Table 2-1 below. (Table 2-1 assumes a member of personnel standing 6ft tall at ground level. The horizontal distance must be scaled upward accordingly if the members of personnel are at a level higher than 6 ft IA-6 Minimum Elevation City Rock Springs Minimum Elevation (deg.) 39 Minimum distance in front of reflector to clear 6 ft. tall person (ft.) 7.4 Minimum distance in front of reflector to clear 1.8m tall person (m) 2.3 Table 2-1 Exclusion Region in Front of Antenna (Random) 6 3. Installation 3.1 Site Selection Determine the optimum mounting location for the antenna radome assembly. It should be installed where: 1. The antenna has a clear line-of-sight of as much of the sky as is practical. Choose a location where masts or other structures do not block the satellite signal from the dish as the boat turns. 2. The antenna is at least 5m away from other transmitting antennae (HF, VHF and radar) which may generate signals with the potential to interfere with the SuperTrack Z series antenna. The further away the SuperTrack Z series antenna is from these other antennae, the less likely is it to be affected by their operation. 3. The antenna radome assembly should be rigidly mounted on the boat. If necessary, reinforce the mounting area to assure that it does not flex due to the boat\\u2019s motion or vibration. 7 Figure 3-1 Best Location Figure 3-2 Antenna Blockages 8 3.2 Unpacking Open the wooden box using pliers and remove the packaging material carefully. Lift the unit out of the box carefully. Do not turn the box and \\u201croll\\u201d the unit out, or turn the box upside down to remove it. Be careful when unpacking the equipment. Figure 3-3 Antenna Wooden Box 9 Remove the jig, screw, and tie used to protect the antenna from shipping damage after opening the radome. If power is supplied to the antenna without removing the fixed parts (jig, screw, tie), the antenna may be damaged. The antenna should be secured using the fixed parts during transportation by truck or another vehicle. So please keep the fixed parts in the event that the antenna is to be moved to a different place or ready to be installed after ground testing. Remove Remove Remove Figure 3-4 Antenna Fixed Part 10 3.3 Installing the Equipment Cables The SuperTrack Z12Mk2 comprises two major sections: The Above-Deck Equipment (ADE) is composed solely of the antenna radome assembly, which is mounted outside. The Below-Decks Equipment (BDE) includes the Antenna Control Unit (ACU), satellite modem(s), and all other items of ancillary equipment. The ADE is connected with the BDE by two coaxial cables; the type of cable to be used depends on the length of cable required. NOTE: Unused coax connections (on the connector bracket) MUST be terminated with a 75 ohm terminator. NOTE: We recommend cable type according to cable length, as follows: -within 20m: RG6 -within 50m: RG11 -within 100m: LMR400 -within 200m: LMR600 NOTE: Impedance of cable is 50ohm. Also you can select the other cable types. However we recommend all attenuation of cable is under 20dB at 2.5GHz. NOTE: When installing the cables, avoid the use of excessive force. Exercise caution during installation of the cables to ensure that they are not severely bent (within the assured bend radius), kinked or twisted, and that the connectors are not damaged. NOTE: Make sure that the cables have been passed through watertight fittings and/or that they will prevent water from entering the ship once their installation has been completed. After the cables have been routed and adjusted for the correct cable length at each end, seal the deck penetration glands and tie the cables securely in place. 11 3.4 Mounting the Antenna Unit 3.4.1 Prepare the Support Post 1. Prepare the antenna support post for the radome. The radome must be bolted to the support post plate. Make sure that the mounting holes have been drilled. Please refer to the appendix for detail drawings. 2. Make sure that the antenna support post is painted appropriately for anti-corrosion. 3. Thread the TX and RX cables from below deck up through the cable access hole on the deck. (Check the number of RF cables required). 4. The support post should be upright. Check the post angle carefully prior to welding the post base to the deck. If it is uneven or not level, weld the clips to the plate or place the foam seal in position on the mounting surface. 5. Refer to Fig 3-5 below. The thickness and size of the support plate can be changed according to the height of the support post Figure 3-5 Diagram of a typical Antenna Support Post (Unit mm) 12 3.4.2 Hoisting the Antenna Refer to the specifications and drawings for the fully assembled weight of your model antenna and ensure that the equipment used to hoist this system is rated accordingly. The antenna assembly is very light for its size and is subject to large swaying motions if hoisted under windy conditions. Always ensure that the tag lines attached to the radome base frame are properly put while the antenna assembly is being hoisted to its assigned location aboard the ship. 1. Ensure that the antenna is secured before hoisting. Check that all the nuts on the base frame assembly have been tightened according to the torque values mentioned above. 2. Using four-eye nuts, and with a tag line attached to the radome base frame, hoist the antenna assembly to its assigned location aboard the ship by means of a suitably- sized crane. Figure 3-6 Hoisting the Antenna 3. Position the base plate in place over the mounting holes and the cable access hole, 13 and then align the radome base plate\\u2019s \\u201cBow\\u201d label (as shown in Figure 3-8) with the ship\\u2019s bow. Figure 3-7 Positioning the Radome 14 Figure 3-8 \\u201cBOW\\u201d Label of the Radome Base 3.4.3 Installing the Radome Assembly Install a flat and spring washers and a mounting bolt (supplied with the product) to each mounting hole of the radome base from the underside of the mounting surface. Apply Locktite to the threads of the mounting bolt up near the mounting surface and tighten each of the 4 bolts to 24 in-lb (21 kg-cm) torque [finger tight, then about 1/4 turn tighter] with a wrench. DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN. If the mounting bolt provided is too short, you will have to install mounting bolts of the appropriate length. If the bolt provided is too long, the excess length of threaded rod that extends above the radome base should be cut off. 15 Figure 3-9 Bolting the Radome/Antenna Figure 3-10 Tighten the nuts from below 16 3.4.4 Installing the Cables Drill two cable access holes at the Radome base. Make sure that the pre-installed TX/RX cables is close to the access holes before drilling. Smooth the edge of the cable access hole and install the Cable Grand to protect the cables. Figure 3-11 Typical Cable Grand Thread the TX/RX cables through the cable access holes and connect them to the connectors of the antenna. Check the labels on both ends of each RF cable to make sure they match the radome base plate connector. Do not use Teflon gel on the cable fittings as it reduces signal strength at high frequencies. Figure 3-12 Connecting the TX/RX Cables 17 Figure 3-13 Antenna on the Support Post NOTE: If the antenna is to be fixed after conducting the ground testing, you have to remove the fixed jig after installing the radome assembly. If you do not remove the fixed jig and then supply power to the antenna, the antenna may be damaged. Please recheck whether the antenna is fixed or free when supplying power to the antenna. 3.5 Mounting the Antenna Control Unit 18 (ACU) Install the ACU in front of a standard 19\\u201d equipment rack or other suitable location. The following are the recommended conditions for the ACU\\u2019s location. 1. The ACU should be placed in a dry location that is convenient for the user. 2. It must not be susceptible to magnetic interference nor be situated on a level surface. 3. It should be placed so that the LCD display is visible and the buttons are accessible. 4. Allow sufficient room at the back to connect all the cables to the rear panel. Figure 3-14 ACU Rack Mounting 19 3.6 Installing the ACU Cables The KA-160 ACU is connected with various systems such as a modem, ship\\u2019s gyro, PC, etc. There are several functional connections that may be made on the various connectors. You may not need to make all of these connections, but they are listed here to enable you to decide which ones you do need to make during installation. 3.6.1 ACU Connectors This section provides detailed ACU connectors, the function of connector. Most ACU connectors are located on the rear of the ACU, as shown in Figure 3-15. Figure 3-15 ACU Rear View 3.6.1.1 DB-15 Gyro Connector Use this connector to connect the ship\\u2019s gyro (synchro gyro, step-by-step gyro, and NMEA output of the gyro compass) to the ACU. Connect the ship\\u2019s gyro to the ACU using a DB-15 female connector. The layout of the pins of the DB-15 connector is shown in Figure 3-16 below. Figure 3-16 Layout of the DB-15 Gyro Connector Pins 20 3.6.1.2 DB-9 NMEA Connector An NMEA Connector provides GPS data to the modem or to any other BDE that requires GPS data. Also, if the internal GPS of a Z12Mk2 is broken, the KA-160 ACU can receive external GPS data via a DB-9 NMEA connector Figure 3-17 layout of the DB-9 NMEA Connector Pins 3.6.1.3 DB-9 Monitor & Control (M&C) Connector The M&C connector is a DB-9 which supports RS-232 data. The baudrate of the M&C connector is fixed to 57600. The user can set and monitor using SuperTrack control software (SCS) V1.7 when the PC is connected to the ACU via an M&C connector. Figure 3-18 Layout of the DB-9 M&C Connector Pins 21 3.6.1.4 I/O and Gyro Strip Connector The I/O and gyro strip connector can receive analog gyro output signals such as Synchro and Step by Step. Figure 3-19 Layout of the I/O & Gyro Strip Connector Pins SW1 and SW2 of the I/O & gyro connector can control the TX mute function of the modem by \\u201ccontact closure\\u201d when the antenna is in the blockage or the preset block area (refer to the operation section). Also, SW1 and SW2 supply the selection signal to coax the switches in VSAT dual-antenna configurations. The user can select \\u2018Contact Closure\\u2019 or \\u2018DC 5V Output\\u2019 by SW1 and SW3 of the ACU board, as shown in Figure 3-22 below.

Make sure that the gyro compass output is turned OFF when handling and connecting the wiring to the ACU gyro connector. 24 3.6.1.5 NMEA Strip Connector If the ship\\u2019s gyro is of the NMEA type, the installer can use an NMEA strip connector. X1, X2, NO are not available. RX+ RX- X1 X2 NO Figure 3-23 Layout of the NMEA Strip Connector Pins NOTE: Do not use the NMEA strip and the DB-15 gyro connector at the same time as this may damage the ACU. 3.6.1.6 RJ-45 Console Port The RJ-45 console port provides the following: Transmits GPS information and transmits Mute, receives TX lock and external AGC values (0~5 VDC). Table 3-3 shows the pins of RJ-45 console port. The signal directions are referenced either into (RX) or out from (TX) the port.

Then, the operator can monitor the state of the antenna using the T-Monitor program when connected to the ACU via the Ethernet. Also, the operator can set the antenna using the SCS V1.7 program. 3.6.1.8 RX & TX Connectors (N-Type) The RX IN connector supplies 48V DC power to the antenna and receives RX signals from the antenna. Also, the KA-160 ACU communicates with the antenna using Bluetooth via the RX IN connector. The RX OUT connector sends RX signals to the satellite modem. The TX IN connector receives TX signals from the satellite modem when using the TX power supply (48V, 150W) of the KA-160 ACU as BUC power. The TX Out connector supplies 48V DC power and sends TX signals to the BUC when using the TX power supply (48V, 150W) of the KA-160 ACU as BUC power. 26 Figure 3-24 Data Flow through the RX and TX Connectors 3.6.2 ACU Cable Connection There are two types of ACU cable connection. The installer can select the connection types as BUC capacity. If the modem cannot support BUC power consumption, the installer will have to use the TX power supply of the ACU or an external power supply. In a standard configuration, the cabling between the above-deck equipment (antenna pedestal) and the below-deck equipment (ACU) only requires TX and RX L-band coaxial cables of a type that will be determined during the installation process (based on the length of the cable required). It is strongly recommended to run the cables directly from the antenna to the ACU, thereby dispensing with the need to go through any IF patch panels to provide the best signal level for viewing. It is important to keep these cables the grounded (outer shield of the coax cable) 27 isolated from any other groundings due to the sensitivity of the CMOS components of the PCU. A good rule of thumb is that the receive (RX) L-band cable be directly connected to the antenna control unit. This is because the receive (RX) L-band cable provides the DC power to the PCU to operate that antenna. Technically speaking, the grounds from the TX and RX IFL runs can be different, but a single piece of cable running from the ACU to the antenna will ensure that the antenna operates properly and protect it from a possible 48 VDC, which supports the optional BUC installation. Refer to Figures 3-25 and 3-26 below for a simplified block diagram of the different sizes of BUC installations.

The ACU is configured with a terminal strip and a DB-15 port. Care must be taken when completing these connections. These wires may conduct high voltages and can damage equipment and/or cause personal injury. For the synchro and step-by-step gyro inputs, the installer must enter the ship\\u2019s heading information for proper operation. Also, it is recommended that a validation test be conducted to determine whether the proper heading updates are being received on the ACU screen. If the ACU heading is being updated in reverse, the ACU can be modified to change the polarity of the incoming voltage. 3.6.3.1 Synchro-Type Gyro Connection In the case of the synchro-type gyro, use the 5 pins (R1, R2, S1, S2, S3) of the DB-15 29 connector or the I/O & gyro strip connector. Gyro DB-15 Pin No. Type 10 R1 2 R2 11 S1 3 S2 4 S3 Table 3-4 Pins Used for the Synchro-Type Gyro NOTE: We recommend AC 11.8~115V (RMS) and 50~500Hz as the input range of the synchro-type gyro. 3.6.3.2 Step-by-Step Type of Gyro Connection Use the 4 pins (COM, S1, S2, S3) of the DB-15 connector or the I/O & gyro strip connector when the ship\\u2019s gyro is of the step-by-step type.

Gyro DB-15 Pin No. Type 8 RX+ 15 RX- Table 3-6 Pins Used for the NMEA Type of Gyro NOTE: KA-160 ACU can accept the various format of NMEA, as follow: HDT; HDG; HDM. But NMEA signal must be matched the regular NMEA format as below. $HEHDT,x.x,T*hh<CR><LF> $HEHDG,x.x,x.x,a,x.x,a*hh<CR><LF> *hh means checksum of format. If there is no this checksum, KA-160 ACU can\\u2019t accept the gyro signal. 3.6.3.4 RJ-45 Connection for Satellite Modem The KA-160 ACU and the satellite modem exchange some data with each other, such as GPS data, TX mute functions, external lock state, and external AGC. Otherwise, please refer to the following: GPS RS-232 Output TX Mute: Supply DC voltage to the modem, \\u20180V\\u2019 means that the antenna is in normal tracking status. \\u20185V\\u2019 means that the antenna is mute or is in block area.

The GPS antenna sends correct GPS data to the PCU when GPS data is available. Then, the PCU sends the GPS data to the ACU. However, if GPS data is not available, the GPS antenna does not send GPS data to the PCU. Also, the GPS antenna will not send GPS data to the PCU if it (GPS) is broken. In this case, the PCU sends default GPS data value to ACU, which is saved data gathered from GPS antenna. The PCU sends the GPS data to the ACU via the receive (RX) L-band cable. The ACU processes and regenerates the GPS information received from the PCU via the DB-9 NMEA (RS232) and the RJ-45 console port. The format and baud rate of the GPS can be configured as GPRMC or GPGLL or GPGGA, and from 1200 to 115200 bps, respectively, using the KA-160 ACU. The DB-9 NMEA and the RJ-45 ports can each have a different format and baud rate. Please refer to the \\u20187.2.8 GPS Output Format & Baudrate\\u2019 of installation mode for further details.

NOTE: If the ship\\u2019s gyro is a GPS compass that has a heading angle and GPS data, the KA-160 ACU can accept the heading angle and the GPS signal via the Gyro connector (DB-15 pins) at the same time. 33 3.6.3.6 M&C Port Connection Use the M&C port when monitoring and configuring the antenna using the PC and SCS ver 1.7. This requires the installation of a serial cable or Mini USB-to-Serial cable for communication between the two devices. Remember that the baud rate of the M&C Port is fixed at 57600.

If you wish to obtain this software, please contact us. 34 4. Theory 4.1 Self-Disciplining Algorithm The greatest difference of the KNS antenna system from other stabilized antennas is its superbly designed algorithm. Pin-point accuracy can be easily obtained with a spectrum analyzer during satellite cut-over. The key reason for this pin-point accuracy is to guarantee the capacity for self-discipline, whereby the algorithm constantly calculates the difference between theoretic and real-time values and disciplines itself accordingly. This algorithm requires very complex computations, and the KNS antenna system uses the 32- bit DSP process with 150 MHz of clock when it performs the calculation at nano-second (10-9) speeds (i.e. a thousand times faster than a micro-second). The motioning patterns in land-mobile and maritime applications are very different. For example, dramatic acceleration or deceleration occurs in land-mobile applications, whereas pitch-roll-yawl motions occur in maritime applications. Some vendor stabilized systems may have up to two different sets of algorithms specific to land-mobile and maritime applications. The KNS stabilizer uses a single algorithm for land-mobile and maritime applications simply because the motion sampling process of the DSP is far faster than any actual motioning condition. 4.2 Searching and Tracking Reference Z12Mk2 antenna uses the \\u201ctuning\\u201d and \\u201cfine tuning\\u201d methods. Searching is a \\u201ctuning\\u201d process which tries to find the satellite by covering a wide range of elevation and azimuth motions; tracking is a \\u201cfine tuning\\u201d process which optimizes the pointing by a \\u201cDish Scan\\u201d mode after searching for the signal of the target satellite. There are seven searching references, as follows: DVB C/N(Carrier to Noise) Threshold; DVB AGC Threshold; RSSD Threshold; DVB Carrier Lock Bit; External Lock Bit; External AGC Threshold; External Lock Bit & DVB C/N Threshold. And, there are three tracking references: DVB Tuner AGC Level; DVB C/N Ratio; and RSSD Level. The ACU can be configured by the operator to function in any combination of Searching and Tracking references. NOTE: With the threshold searching references the antenna will perform a search pattern until the receive level measured by the RSSD or DVB tuners exceeds the pre- configured threshold level. 35 4.2.1 Searching Reference 4.2.1.1 DVB C/N Threshold The antenna searches for the satellite using the DVB tuner and a C/N threshold level. The antenna \\u201cbelieves\\u201d that it points towards the target satellite whenever the DVB C/N level is above the threshold. Hence, the threshold level value should be carefully selected to ensure the success of the searching process. 4.2.1.2 DVB AGC Threshold The antenna searches for the satellite using the DVB tuner and an AGC threshold level. The DVB tuner measures a power spectrum of about 2 MHz at its tuned center frequency and represents its strength as an AGC level (higher is stronger). The antenna \\u201cbelieves\\u201d that it is pointing towards the target satellite whenever the DVB AGC level is above the preset threshold. Hence, the threshold level value should be carefully selected to ensure the success of the searching process. 4.2.1.3 RSSD Threshold The antenna searches for the satellite using an RSSD threshold level. RSSD measures a power spectrum of about 50 KHz at its tuned center frequency and represents the strength as an RSSD level (higher is stronger). The antenna \\u201cbelieves\\u201d that it points towards the target satellite whenever the RSSD level is above the threshold. Hence, the threshold level value should be carefully selected to ensure the success of the searching process. 4.2.1.4 DVB Carrier Lock Bit The antenna searches for the satellite using the DVB carrier lock. We recommend a DVB carrier lock bit as a searching reference if a DVB carrier is available. The search speed is much faster than other searching references. If the antenna points towards the target satellite and the DVB tuner has the correct carrier parameters, the DVB demodulator locks on the carrier and sets the lock bit on, which means the antenna is pointing towards the correct satellite, provided that an 36 identical DVB carrier is not present on an adjacent satellite (low probability). This requires the DVB tuner to be configured with the correct carrier parameters, such as frequency, symbol rate, and FEC. 4.2.1.5 External Lock Bit The antenna searches for the satellite using the logical voltage status of an external contact closure (CC). Lock bit state by the logical voltage depends on the type of modem. In the case of an HNS modem, when the voltage level of the CC is logical high (2.6~5VDC), the lock bit is considered to be on. Conversely, the iDirect modem\\u2019s lock bit is on when the logical voltage is low. For the specifications of each, please refer to the modem manual. Like the in-built DVB tuner, some external demodulators are capable of generating a lock signal when the carrier is locked. This information can be used for searching in the same manner as the DVB carrier lock. However, the response time of the external device between detecting lock and setting lock on must be as fast as the speed of the Z12Mk2 searching process. To keep the response times to a minimum, it is necessary to use a lower value for the acquisition range (no higher than 30 KHz) and a PLL-based LNB (LNB stability should be within 10Khz). NOTE: A drawback occurs when antenna is in the tracking process and the lock bit is off (logically unlocked) stemming from the loss of CC connection. And then, the antenna returns to the searching process. This will also apply to the External AGC threshold if used for searching. 4.2.1.6 External AGC Threshold The antenna searches for the satellite using the AGC threshold level of an external device like an in-built DVB tuner. Some external demodulators are capable of generating an AGC level RX carrier strength from an analog voltage level. This information can be used for searching in the same manner as the RSSD or DVB AGC threshold. However, if the response time between detecting the change of the carrier level and generating an AGC level is slow, it cannot be used. To keep the response time to a minimum, it is necessary to use a minimum value of acquisition range 37 and PLL-based LNB. NOTE: A drawback occurs when the antenna is in the tracking process and the AGC level is below the preset threshold (logically unlocked), due to the disconnection with the CC source. After that, the antenna restarts the searching process. This also applies to the External Lock Bit. 4.2.1.7 External Lock Bit & C/N Threshold The antenna searches for the satellite using the external lock bit and the C/N (AGC value of modem) threshold level. 4.2.2 Tracking Reference The tracking algorithm uses selected energy level variations while the antenna scanning process is on. The tracking process is only initiated when the searching conditions have been met. 4.2.2.1 RSSD Level The antenna tracks the satellite by dish-scan by reading the RSSD power level of 100 KHz of the desired carrier for the target satellite. Usually, the RSSD frequency is the L- band frequency of the target carrier, but the user can change the RSSD frequency to the desired L-band frequency. 4.2.2.2 DVB AGC Level The antenna tracks the satellite by dish-scan by reading the DVB AGC level changes of the desired carrier on the target satellite. AGC level tracking may result in tracking off from the target satellite, when there is severe interference from an adjacent satellite that has a stronger carrier level. 4.2.2.3 DVB C/N Ratio The antenna tracks the satellite by dish-scan by reading the DVB C/N ratio change of the desired DVB carrier on the target satellite. The DVB tuner C/N ratio is very useful where there is adjacent satellite interference (ASI). ASI can create a higher energy level 38 but will reduce the C/N ratio at the same time. The C/N ratio tracking method will not cause the antenna to track off the target satellite. 4.3 Methods of Finding Satellite Z12Mk2 has four satellite finding methods: manual pointing, auto searching, manual searching, and reference searching. The user can select the proper method by satellite. 4.3.1 Manual Pointing In this pointing method, the user controls the antenna manually by entering the desired EL and AZ. The ACU will not perform any searching pattern but tracking is always on. This is a handy option, and is used primarily during the initial installation and troubleshooting process. 4.3.2 Manual Searching The EL and AZ values are entered manually in lieu of being automatically calculated by the ACU. The antenna first points the manually-entered EL and AZ values and then performs the search to locate the target satellite. After the searching condition has been met, the antenna will automatically enter a tracking mode. 4.3.3 Auto Searching Auto-Searching is the most recommended searching method. The system runs a built- in satellite calibration program using pre-configured information such as satellite longitude and automated GPS (site) location data, which can be manually entered in the case of a GPS failure. The program calculates the EL and AZ values, and then the antenna points to that calculated satellite position and begins the search process to find the target satellite. After the searching condition has been met, the antenna enters into the tracking mode. 39 4.3.4 Reference Searching In cases where the target carrier of the desired satellite and the carrier of the adjacent satellite have the same parameters (frequency, symbol rate, FEC, etc the antenna can search for the carrier of the adjacent satellite. This method is strongly recommended in such cases. To use this method, the user must select the reference satellite which is certain to search and track the carrier. The reference searching process is as given below. Please refer to Figures 4-1 and 4-2 below. a. First, the antenna searches and tracks the reference satellite. b. The antenna tracks the reference carrier for 10 seconds. c. Then, the antenna searches for the desired carrier. 40 Figure 4-1 Step 1 of Reference Searching (Definition) 41 Figure 4-2 Step 2 of Reference Searching (Start the Reference Searching) 4.4 Searching Standard Z12Mk2 with DVB-S2 has four searching standard methods: manual pointing, auto, DVB S1, DVB S2, DSS. The user can select the proper method according to desired carrier. 4.4.1 Auto In this searching standard method, PCU will analyze the carrier using DVB tuner for tracking of carrier. But \\u2018Auto\\u2019 mode spends more time to search the carrier. So we recommend the other methods like \\u2018DVB S1\\u2019 or \\u2018DVB S2\\u2019, \\u2018DSS\\u2019. 4.4.2 DVB S1 In this searching standard method, PCU will search the DVB S1 carrier. User must know the proper system encryption to find desired carrier. 4.4.3 DVB S2 Select this method, if your desired carrier is using the DVB S2 encryption. 4.4.4 DSS Select this method, if your desired carrier is using the DSS encryption. 42 4.5 LNB Compatibility To validate the LNB compatibility, the operator must know the following steps. 1. RF downlink frequency in Ku-band: If the searching and tracking reference is configured for an RSSD or DVB carrier, then the operator must know the center frequency of the RF down-link (receive) within the range of 10.95 ~ 12.75 GHz (Ku- band RX frequency range). 2. LNB input frequency range: The LNB specifications sheet or manufacturer\\u2019s label on the LNB usually identifies the input frequency range. 3. This value can also be calculated from the LNB LO frequency and the output frequency range. 4. The BW of the carrier which the modem is receiving: Carrier size given in MHz. 5. The LNB stability: The specifications of the LNB usually include its stability. First, the installer should determine whether: 1. The RF downlink frequency is within the 2 LNB input frequency. If not, the DVB or RSSD tuner cannot be locked on the carrier. 2. If the searching reference is RSSD (narrow band tuner) or external lock, it is important to use an LNB with 10 KHz stability; typically, a DRO LNB has 500 KHz of stability, which can be problematic at best if the tracking carrier is a very narrow carrier, as in a beacon and CW carrier. Also, the external modem can\\u2019t lock on fast enough with the installed LNB with 500 KHz of stability, which is also problematic if the external lock is used for the searching method. NOTE: The KNS antenna supports a universal LNB. The DC voltage selects different LO frequencies to cover the entire Ku-band. However, most universal LNBs are of the DRO type, where stability is 500 KHz. 43 4.6 BUC Compatibility The block up-converter (BUC) is a device comprising an up-converter and power amplifier in a single package. It has an operating frequency range which supports standard Ku-band frequencies from 14 ~ 14.5 GHz, while the extended Ku-band operates in the frequency range of 13.75GHz ~ 14.5GHz. It is important to make sure that the desired carrier frequency is within the operating range of the BUC. Most BUCs require a 10 MHz external reference and a DC voltage from the modem or the ACU. However, if a BUC is activated with an internal 10 MHz reference, there is no need to provide 10 MHz reference from the modem. Make sure that the proper DC voltages are provided to the BUC. The equipment will be damaged if a 24 VDC BUC is provided with voltage of 48 VDC, which is generally used in larger BUCs. Note that, currently, the ACU only provides 48 VDC down the TX IFL cable. 44 5. Initial Configuration After installing the radome assembly and the ACU, the Z12Mk2 antenna must be configured with some parameters to ensure correct operation of the antenna. This section concerns \\u2018How to configure the antenna for the first time\\u2019. If the initial configuration is incorrect, it may have a detrimental effect on the antenna\\u2019s operation. 5.1 Supply AC Power During the initial power-up sequence, the ACU provides DC current (48 VDC) via the receive (RX) L-band cable. The ACU has a built-in short-circuit protection to ensure that there is no short circuit between the center conductor of the L-Band RX cable and the shield or other metallic surfaces. 5.1.1 ACU Operation Procedures The KA-160 ACU is initialized as shown in Figure 5-1 or Figure 5-2 of the ship\\u2019s gyro types when the ACU power is on. Figure 5-1 ACU Starting Normal Operation (Gyro Type: NMEA, Synchro 1:1) 45 Figure 5-2 ACU Starting Operation Requiring Heading Angle (Gyro Type: Other) If the ship\\u2019s gyro is of the NMEA or Sync 1:1 type, the ACU operates normally. In other cases, the user has to input the ship\\u2019s current heading angle into the ACU, or else the ACU will not operate. 5.1.2 Bluetooth Communication The Z12Mk2 and the KA 160 ACU communicate with each other using Bluetooth. The 46 Bluetooth data flows via the RX (L-band) cable. All data are transported by Bluetooth, except for the RX signal and DC power. The ACU Bluetooth connects with the preset PCU Bluetooth when the ACU is initializing. The antenna is initializing when the connection of ACU Bluetooth and PCU Bluetooth is a success. Bluetooth was paired in a factory, but the user must re-pair the Bluetooth if the Bluetooth module is changed. Refer to Figure 5-3 below. Figure 5-3 Bluetooth Pairing Step NOTE: You can see the Bluetooth systems around the ACU when pairing the Bluetooth, so you have to select the proper Bluetooth module. Our Bluetooth module\\u2019s name is \\u2018ESD\\u2019 and Bluetooth module\\u2019s address is on the top side of the Bluetooth module. 5.1.3 Main Display of the ACU You can see the parameters, such as those given below in Figure 5-4, after connecting Bluetooth. 47 S: 60: Satellite ID. Z12Mk2 has 80 ID as 1~80. z SAT0: Satellite name. Operator changes the satellite\\u2019s name; please refer to \\u2018Configuration Mode\\u2019 to change the satellite\\u2019s name. z 116.0E: Longitude of the satellite. z INIT *: State of antenna. means that the receive signal is not stable or that the antenna is in the preset block area. z AZI: Azimuth angle of the antenna\\u2019s pointing position. z ELE: Elevation angle of the antenna\\u2019s pointing position. z REL: Relative angle of the ship\\u2019s bow and the antenna\\u2019s pointing position. z POL: Polarity (Skew angle) z AGC: Energy level as tracking reference : DVB AGC or DVB C/N or RSSD z HDG: Heading angle of the ship\\u2019s gyro Satellite Number Logitude of Satellite Azimuth Angle of Antenna Relative Angle of Ship and Antenna Signal Strength Satellite Name Status of Antennal Elevation Angle of Antenna Polarization Angle Ship\\u2019s Heading Angle KA-160 Figure 5-4 Main Display of ACU 5.2 Alignment of the Antenna and the Ship\\u2019s Bow We recommend that the bow mark of the radome base be aligned with the ship\\u2019s bow for correct tracking of the satellite. But the ship\\u2019s mounting condition usually varies and is 48 limited, so the installer can mount the antenna in a direction other than the recommended direction. If the antenna is mounted in another direction, the installer must re-set the heading offset. Please refer to the steps outlined below to configure the heading offset. NOTE: Heading offset is only required when the PCU compass mode is \\u2018NORMAL\\u2019, \\u2018ENHD FAILED (Enhanced Failed \\u2018GYRO FAILED\\u2019. An internal magnetic mode does not reuquire the heading offset. Please refer to \\u2018Installation Mode\\u2019 to determine the PCU compass mode. NOTE: Heading offset only affects the azimuth angle, and has nothing to do with elevation. 5.2.1 Confirming the Current Heading Offset You can see the current heading offset in the \\u2018Installation Mode\\u2019 as shown in Figure 4-4 below. Be sure to remember the current heading angle before moving to the next step. Figure 5-5 Confirming the Current Heading Angle 5.2.2 Determining the Heading Discrepancy Input the current heading offset in \\u2018NEW ANGLE\\u2019 to determine the heading discrepancy. Then, the antenna will move to the heading offset position established at the factory. The angle between the pointing direction of the antenna and the ship\\u2019s bow is the heading discrepancy. 49 Figure 5-6 Inputting the Current Heading Angle Open the hatch of the radome and look at the antenna inside the radome to determine the heading discrepancy, as shown in Figure 5-7 below. NOTE: The direction of the heading offset is as shown in Figure 5-8. If you want the antenna to move counter-clockwise, you have to input a positive value. CAUTION: The heading offset must be correct for quick and exact operation. We recommend that the heading discrepancy remain within \\u00b15 degrees. If the heading discrepancy is as high as \\u00b110 degrees, the antenna will not be able to search for the satellite. 50 Figure 5-7 Determining the Heading Discrepancy Figure 5-8 Direction of the Heading Offset 51 5.2.3 Adjusting the Heading Offset Refer to Figure 5-9 below for adjustment of the heading offset. Figure 5-9 Heading Offset adjusting Steps NOTE: Save the changed parameters in \\u2018Installer Mode\\u2019 after adjusting the heading offset. Otherwise, the antenna will remember only the preset heading offset. Refer to \\u2018Installer Mode\\u2019 if you would like to know how to save it. 52 6. Configuration of the STR and the DVB Tuner The STR (Searching and Tracking Reference) and the DVB tuner can be configured manually from the ACU front key or from the remote software (SCS Ver. 1.7). Regardless of whether they use the ACU front panel or remote software to configure the STR and the DVB tuner, users should at least prepare all the information required to configure the STR and the DVB tuner, namely: satellite orbit location and polarity, searching and tracking reference, compatibility of LNB LO frequency, etc. 6.1 Deciding Searching Tracking Reference With the Z12Mk2 antenna, there are multiple search and tracking options, as previously discussed. Operators need to decide which searching and tracking option to use from among multiple selections. The searching reference is used to provide a \\u201csense\\u201d, on the basis of which the antenna determines whether it is pointing to the correct satellite or not. Please refer to 4.2 Searching & Tracking Reference for a detailed explanation of its operation. Lock-bit searching is preferred to threshold searching because the latter cannot guarantee the correct pointing out of the desired satellite, although its searching speed will be faster than that of lock-bit searching. Recommended Preference Searching Reference Very High DVB Carrier Lock with Reliable DVB carrier: As the DVB tuner provides a very fast response, this reference will result in the fastest searching speed while guaranteeing targeting accuracy. High External Lock with external device: This option will find the satellite a little slower than the DVB carrier lock because the current searching speed is tuned to iDirect\\u2019s response time, which is not as fast as that of the DVB tuner. However, this option, if available, will guarantee that the antenna always targets the correct satellite as long as an external device can provide the RX lock signal. One 53 drawback would be that the antenna will return to search when the external device is disconnected or the external carrier is down, which may be problematic during troubleshooting. Medium RSSD Threshold: Sometimes, the user transmits a CW carrier with a very high C/N or the satellite may have very strong beacon carrier with a unique frequency. (Caution: Please make sure that the adjacent satellite is not using the same frequency for the beacon signal These carriers can be used for the purpose of searching and tracking sources. In such cases, the RSSD tuner is recommended because it has a very narrow BW of about 100KHz. However, the RSSD must be used with a PLL-LNB with a high stability option. DVB C/N Threshold: We recommend the DVB C/N threshold instead of the RSSD threshold when the antenna has no RSSD tuner or if the RSSD tuner is broken. The DVB tuner can correctly detect the desired carrier better than the DVB AGC threshold because the noise level increases with the energy level when there is interference from an adjacent satellite. Note, with the threshold option, reference searching is the recommended Sat. Finding method because it increases the targeting accuracy. Medium-low DVB AGC Threshold: The DVB tuner can only detect the energy level, like RSSD. However, the valid detection range of BW is within 2MHz. EXT. AGC Threshold: This option is not recommended if the response time of the external device is slow. As such, it would not be advisable to use it with the iDirect modem due to its slow response time. Table 6-1 Preference of searching reference One of the most important facts when considering the tracking reference is how well the tracking reference can resist interference from an adjacent satellite or a local radar/microwave, etc. For example, C/N ratio tracking is preferred to AGC level tracking. 54 When there is some interference, the C/N ratio is reduced, which renders the antenna incapable of tracking towards the interfering source, while the AGC level increases, which makes the antenna track towards the interference source. Recommended Preference Tracking Reference High DVB AGC LEVEL: The most recommended tracking reference is DVB AGC if a DVB carrier is available. DVB AGC tracking can keep the antenna point correct because fluctuation is lower than with DVB C/N. Medium RSSD LEVEL: When there is no reliable DVB carrier available on the satellite, RSSD is the next preferred reference. It has a very narrow BW so that the frequency can be tuned into a \\u201csweet spot\\u201d when there is interference. However, LNB must have very good stability. DVB C/N RATIO: This option is recommended when there is severe interference from an adjacent satellite (ASI) or a local radar/microwave, etc. Table 6-2 Preference of tracking reference 6.2 Example of Using the DVB carrier The DVB carrier is the most recommended method of searching and tracking if the desired DVB carrier is available. The polarity, beam type, and LNB operating frequency range of the DVB carrier must be the same as those which the on-board satellite\\u2019s modem is using. Most public DVB carriers can be found in www.Lyngsat.com. The benefit of using a DVB carrier is that it fully utilizes a state-of-the-art KNS built-in DVB tuner, so the probability of tracking the wrong satellite is very low. Also, typically, the uptime of a DVB carrier is very high. When maintenance is being carried out on the carrier which the satellite\\u2019s modem is using, antenna tracking is not interrupted. NOTE: If possible, it is recommended to pre-configure the necessary parameters to use an external lock even though the DVB lock has already been selected as the searching 55 reference. 1. How to choose the DVB carrier using www.Lyngsat.com: 2. Click the desired region (Asia, Europe, Atlantic, America). 3. Select the desired satellite. 4. Write down the four parameters (Frequency, Polarity, Symbol rate, FEC) from the selected DVB carrier. TP. Freq RF RX Frequency(MHz) H/V Polarity of Carrier (Horizontal/Vertical) System Encryption System encryption type : DVBS1, DVBS2, DSS Symbol Rate - the symbol rate unit used by Lyngsat is Kilo- symbols per second (Ksps). NOTE: The NID is not recommended for use with a public DVB carrier in cases where the NID is not inserted frequently or fast enough to be used in the searching process. 56 6.3 Example of Configuration of the STR and the DVB Tuner When Using the DVB Carrier This section provides an example of configuration in steps. Desired satellite parameters (DVB) Satellite: Astra 3A Satellite Longitude: 23.5\\u00b0E Frequency TP: 12,605MHz Polarity: Horizontal (Down link) System encryption: DVB-S2 Symbol Rate: 27500KHz NOTE: FEC rate isn\\u2019t required in DVBS2 tuner.

If the RX polarity is \\u2018Horizontal\\u2019, then the TX polarity is \\u2018Vertical\\u2019. However, some satellites have what is known as co-pol. We supply co-pol kits for co-pol satellites. Please contact us for further details. 59 Figure 6-3 Co-pol Kits (Optional) 60 NOTE: If you examine the specifications of the LNB, you can find the operating range. The operating frequency of the KU-down link is 10.95 ~ 12.75GHz = 1.8GHz of BW. But the standard LNB covers 500 MHz of BW, while a wide-band LNB covers 750 MHz. The output of 750 MHz LNB is 950~1700 MHz, but the extra 250 MHz may not be useful if the satellite\\u2019s modem supports 950~1450 MHz. No matter how good an LNB is, it will not be able to cover 1.8 GHz while meeting the necessary RF performance. Thus, it is important to use an LNB that covers your operating frequency. LNBs can be categorized by the fixed frequency of their local oscillator (LO).

This LNB has four local oscillators. The operator can select the desired oscillator according to the LNB input voltage and 22KHz tone. EXAMPLE: If your desired RF frequency is 12.565GHz, you have to select the 11.3GHz as LNB local frequency. For that, you must set the 11300MHz to \\u2018LNB Low Local Frequency\\u2019, and then select [18V Low]. Please refer to the \\u2018DVB Tuner Configuration\\u2019 step.

The operator can see simultaneous readings of all the S&T references, and select any one of the pre-configured S & T references as an active reference (so that it can be used in the searching and tracking process), and then enters its AGC threshold level. \\u2018 \\u2019 Figure 7-15 Configuration Temp S&T Reference C:L/U DVB Tuner lock status 75 L = Locked U = Unlocked E:L/U External device lock status L = Locked U = Unlocked A: X DVB AGC Level C:X DVB C/N Level R:X RSSD Level E:X External device AGC Level 7.1.9 Yaw Axis Initialize (Key \\u20188\\u2019) This configuration is required when the gyro is in need of repair. \\u2018 \\u2019 Figure 7-16 Yaw Axis Initialize Configuration 7.1.10 Searching ON/OFF (Key Searching OFF is a special function to prevent the antenna from going into the searching process when a searching problem occurs, such as a tracking failure. The Searching OFF function is very useful when there are frequent blockages of short duration. If you select Searching ON, any blockage (up to searching delay) causes the antenna to go searching wherever the searching pattern has been initiated. 76 Figure 7-17 Configuration of Searching ON/OFF 7.1.11 Tracking ON/OFF (Key Under certain test environments, the operator can turn off the tracking process. When the tracking is turned off, the antenna ceases its conical scanning and points towards the current position. Figure 7-18 Configuration of Tracking ON/OFF 77 7.1.12 STR ID (Key With this configuration, the operator can select a different S&T Ref. ID. When selecting an S&T reference, the antenna starts the searching and tracking processes as per the parameters based on the selected STR. If the new STR uses a different satellite, then the antenna will search for a different satellite. For example, let\\u2019s assume that there are two fully-configured records of the STR, i.e. 01:SMX5 (Satmex-5) and 02:NSS7 (NSS7). If the antenna is using STR 01:SMX5 and the operator selects 02:IA07, then the antenna will search and track the NSS-7 satellite as per the details of STR record 02:NSS7. To use this option effectively, it is recommended that the operator configures multiple records of the Searching and Tracking Reference (STR) in advance for multiple satellites. Figure 7-19 Configuration of STR ID NOTE: The operator can change the satellite\\u2019s name using the ACU key pad. Refer to Figure 7-18 below if you wish to change the satellite\\u2019s name. 78 Figure 7-20 Changing the Satellite\\u2019s Name 7.1.13 Checking the Signal Status (Key If this function is entered, the operator can check the status of the signal, the NID of the signal, and the automatic beam switching mode. a. Status of signal Figure 7-21 Status of Signal b. Network ID In the case of the correct DVB carrier, the PCU analyses the NID (Network ID) from the 79 target satellite\\u2019s signal. The ACU displays the Network ID (NID) on an LCD. Figure 7-22 NID c. Automatic beam switching mode The operator can check the automatic beam switching mode, as shown in Figure 7-23 below. If the automatic beam switching mode is off, the ACU displays the recent value. Figure 7-23 Automatic Beam Switching 80 7.2 Installation Mode If you push and hold the \\u201c\\u00c5\\u201d key in the main display for 2~3 seconds, you can enter the \\u2018Installation Mode\\u2019. The \\u2018Installation Mode\\u2019 has 17 sub menus. Use this mode when replacing any board or hardware, or when changing the gyro type, etc. NOTE: You must save the changed parameters when you change any parameter to the desired parameter. If the new parameters are not saved, they will be lost the next time the ACU is power cycled, and the previous parameters will be restored. 7.2.1 Bluetooth Initialize The antenna and the ACU communicate with each other using Bluetooth via an RX cable. When the Bluetooth module is replaced, it is necessary to pair the Bluetooth. Please refer to the \\u2018Bluetooth Communication\\u2019 section of \\u2018Initial Configuration\\u2019. Figure 7-24 Pairing the Bluetooth 81 7.2.2 Ship Heading Offset The antenna\\u2019s heading must be aligned with the ship\\u2019s heading to ensure accuracy of searching and tracking. This only concerns the antenna pointing position and the ship\\u2019s bow when configuring the heading offset. Please refer to \\u20185.2.2 Determine Heading Discrepancy\\u2019 to find out how to calculate the heading discrepancy. Figure 7-25 Configuration of Ship Heading Offset by Steps 7.2.3 Searching Parameter Setting The searching parameter is a range which the antenna searches for the satellite from the position derived from PCU. If it is too narrow, the antenna will not be able to search for the antenna. Also, if it is too wide, the antenna searching time will be slower than inputting the proper parameter. Please be deliberate when changing the searching range. z Azi(Azimuth) Range : Searching range (degree) of azimuth axis z Ele(Elevation) Range : Searching range (degree) of elevation z Step : Increase range in former step z SCH (Searching) Delay : Time-out for automatic initiation of a search when the 82 signal level drops below the threshold level or the antenna loses of the lock bit. Figure 7-26 Searching Range Figure 7-27 Configuration of Searching Parameter 83 7.2.4 Polarity Calibration This setting is required when the skew block or the PCU is replaced. During normal operation, any change in this parameter other than a factory set value may cause faulty operation of the automatic polarity adjustment The skew block must be zeroed by setting this configuration, when replacing the skew block or the PCU. The skew zero position is as shown in Figure 7-28 below. The top side of the skew plate runs parallel to the cross bar. The skew block is moved by \\u2018Jog\\u2019 or \\u2018Manual\\u2019 mode. The jog and manual modes of the installation mode are the same as the jog and manual modes of polarity configuration. Refer to \\u2018Polarity (Key \\u20184 Figure 7-28 Skew Zero Position 84 Figure 7-29 Skew Zero Setting Use \\u2018Scale factor setting\\u2019 to optimize the skew angle when it is at +90 or -90 degrees. Figure 7-30 Skew Scale Factor Setting 85 7.2.5 Block Area Setting The signal from a satellite to the antenna is a line-of-sight (LOS) signal which enables ship structures to block the signal in a certain azimuth angle. When the antenna is transmitting during this structural blockage, it may cause harmful interference or radiation. During the initial installation, the installer can store up to three blocking areas in the ACU flash memory, from which the ACU can determine whether the antenna is within a block area or not, and send a contact-closure (CC) signal via the SW1 and SW2 positions. It is normally closed (NC) for non-blocking areas. This CC can be used by the operator to control an RF inhibit function (transmission on or off). NOTE: The azimuth angle of the block area is calculated relatively to the ship heading. NOTE: The operator can set the 3 elevation zones and 3 azimuth zones to the block area. Figure 7-31 Block Area Setting 86 7.2.6 ACU Gyro Compass Type There are multiple types of Gyro compasses, each of which requires a unique selection. The KNS antenna supports the following Gyro type. NMEA 0183 SYNC 360:1 SYNC 180:1 SYNC 90:1 SYNC 36:1 SYNC 1:1 STEP 360:1 STEP 180:1 STEP 90:1 NOTE: SYNC and STEP gyros require a direction setting which provides two choices: Normal and Reverse. NOTE: The SYNC gyro also requires a frequency setting which provides two choices: 50/60Hz and 400/500Hz. When the Direction setting = NORMAL, a change in voltage is proportional to a change of heading within a defined ratio (e.g. 1:1, 360:1, etc When the Direction setting = REVERSE, a change of voltage is inversely proportional to a change of heading in a defined ratio (e.g. 1:1, 360:1, etc 87 Figure 7-32 Configuration of Gyro Compass Type 7.2.7 PCU Compass Mode There are four modes, as outlined below. The operator can select the PCU compass type according to the state of the ship\\u2019s gyro. The antenna will start initializing after selection of the PCU compass mode. a. NORMAL (GYRO COMPASS): Select the \\u2018NORMAL\\u2019 mode when using the ship\\u2019s gyro. The ACU provides GYRO info to the PCU, which the PCU uses for its computation. For Gyro cable connection, refer to \\u20183.6.3 ACU Gyro Compass Cable Connection\\u2019. b. FAILED (Failed GYRO COMPASS): In the event that a gyro compass is not available, the user must select the \\u2018FAILED\\u2019 mode and must manually input the heading value. 88 (Refer to \\u20187.1.3 Ship Heading\\u2019 for inputting the heading value.) The PCU uses the heading angle when the PCU is receiving the STR ID command from the ACU or when the antenna is searching for the satellite after initializing of the antenna. c. ENHD FAILED (Enhanced Gyro Failure Mode): The \\u2018ENHD FAILED\\u2019 mode is an enhanced version of the \\u2018FAILED\\u2019 mode. In the case of the \\u2018ENHD FAILED\\u2019 mode, the PCU uses the heading angle when the antenna starts another search for the satellite after search failure. NOTE: The Z12Mk2 points to the calculated position for about 30 seconds when the antenna\\u2019s satellite search fails, whereupon the antenna starts another search for the satellite. d. INT. COMPASS (Internal Magnetic Mode): The Z12Mk2 has an internal magnetic sensor in a sensor cage. The PCU uses the azimuth angle obtained from the internal magnetic sensor for its computation. NOTE: \\u201cINT. COMPASS\\u2019 mode is useful when testing the antenna on the ground without an external gyro signal. However, this mode is not recommended in cases where any of the ship\\u2019s material consists of a magnetic metal, as this can affect the magnetic field of the internal magnetic sensor, and the azimuth angle of the antenna will consequently differ from the real azimuth angle. If there are no non-magnetic metals among the materials of your ship, you can use the \\u2018INT. COMPASS\\u2019 mode. But internal magnetic value is more incorrect than gyro compass value, so we recommend that the antenna is used with a gyro compass. 7.2.8 GPS Output Format & Baudrate The ACU provides GPS information via two external ports, the NMEA output port and the CONSOLE port. The format and baud rate of each port can be configured separately. The pin-out from the console port is specially designed. Please refer to \\u20183.6.3.4 RJ-45 Connection for Satellite Modem\\u2019 for the pin-out of the console port. NMEA DB-9 FORMAT: GPRMC/GPGLL/GPGGA CON RJ-45 FORMAT: GPRMC/GPGLL/GPGGA NMEA DB-9 BAUDRATE: 1200~115200 CON RJ-45 BAUDRATE: 1200~115200 89 Figure 7-33 Configuration of GPS Format & Baudrate 7.2.9 Tilt Sensor Offset The Tilt sensor has two axes: level and cross. When a tilt sensor or PCU is replaced, both axes must be leveled by adjusting the offset of each tilt axis. The bubble inclinometer on the top side of the level cage is used to do this. The bubble must be placed in the center after the adjustment. LEVEL OFFSET ANGLE: Adjust this value by using the up and down keys or by typing the value until the level axis of the tilt sensor box has leveled. (Press Key ENT to execute the value) CORSS OFFSET ANGLE: Adjust this value by using the up and down keys or by typing the value until the cross axis of the tilt sensor box has leveled. (Press Key ENT to execute the value) NOTE: The antenna will be initializing when entering the \\u2018TILT SENSOR OFFSET\\u2019 or selecting the \\u2018INITIALIZE: YES\\u2019 after the adjustment. 90 Figure 7-34 Configuration of Tilt Offset 7.2.10 TX DC 48V Power ON/OFF The ACU has a built-in 48V DC power supply, (150W). Most L-band modems can supply 24V DC power and support BUCs up to 4~6 Watts. When a customer requires an 8W BUC, such modems cannot supply enough power, so an external DC power supply is commonly used. With a built-in 150W DC power supply dedicated to a TX BUC, the ACU can provide enough power to the BUC. For applications using less than 6W BUC, most standard L-band modems can provide DC power internally (24V DC). The operator can control the TX DC voltage using the \\u2018TX POWER MUTE\\u2019 function. If you select \\u2018ENABLE\\u2019, the antenna shuts off the TX DC voltage when the antenna is in blockage or when the antenna is not tracking the satellite. But we do not recommend that you shut off the TX DC power, because the BUC can cause electrical damage. NOTE: The default TX DC power voltage is 48V. We can install the 24V TX power supply (optional), if the dealer requests it. NOTE: If the BUC is installed by the operator (not by KNS), then please be aware that 91 the voltage is 48V. Figure 7-35 TX DC Mute Function & CC using Console Port 7.2.11 Azimuth and Elevation Trim Use the \\u2018Azimuth and Elevation Trim\\u2019 when it is necessary to adjust the heading offset and cage offset while the antenna is tracking the satellite. (Condition for trim: Valid GPS data, Tracking of correct target satellite (Correct satellite longitude), Correct heading angle) Azimuth Trim: When the operator selects the \\u2018Azimuth and Elevation Trim\\u2019 function, the PCU calculates the discrepancy between the calculated azimuth angle and the current azimuth angle. Then, the PCU changes the heading offset to the new heading offset. Discrepancy of Azimuth Angle = Calculated Azimuth Angle by PCU \\u2013 Current Azimuth Angle New Heading Offset = Current Heading Offset \\u2013 Discrepancy of Azimuth Angle Elevation Trim: When the operator selects the \\u2018Azimuth and Elevation Trim\\u2019 function, the PCU calculates the discrepancy between the calculated elevation angle and the current elevation angle. Then, the PCU changes the cage offset to the new cage offset. Discrepancy of Elevation Angle = Calculated Elevation Angle by PCU \\u2013 Current Elevation Angle New Cage Offset = Current Cage Offset \\u2013 Discrepancy of Cage Angle 92 Figure 7-36 Azimuth and Elevation Trim (Steps) NOTE: Cage offset is configured by a KNS engineer during factory setting. The operator cannot change the cage offset, except the \\u2018Azimuth and Elevation Trim\\u2019. NOTE: The operator must save the changed parameters using \\u2018SAVE NEW PARAMETER\\u2019. 7.2.12 Diagnostic for Sensor and Driver The operator can check the operating state of the antenna using \\u2018Diagnostic for Sensor and Driver\\u2019. The operator can see the following parameters.

This function is the \\u2018Automatic Beam Switching (ABS The ACU receives the ABS protocol via the NMEA port or the Ethernet port. Figure 7-38 ABS Protocol Configuration 95 7.2.14 External Lock TTL Level When the searching reference is \\u2018External Lock Bit\\u2019, the ACU receives the lock signal via the RJ45 console port from the satellite modem. If this lock signal is DC voltage, the ACU considers 2.6~5VDC as logical high and anything less than 2.6VDC as logical low. The lock signal varies according to the manufacturer. Logical high is the lock signal in the HNS modem, whereas iDirect modem\\u2019s lock is logical low. Please refer to the modem manual. Figure 7-39 External Lock TTL Level Configuration 96 7.2.15 TCP/IP v4 Setting The installer and operator can access to the ACU from outer devices using the Ethernet. You must configure the host IP address, gateway, and subnet-mask to use the Ethernet. We provide remote access software (SCS V1.7 & TMonitor) to the dealer. If you want to obtain this software, please contact us. Figure 7-40 TCP/IP v4 Setting Steps 97 7.2.16 Save New Parameters Please save all the changed parameters, or they will be lost the next time the ACU is power cycled, and the previous parameters will be restored. Figure 7-41 Saving Steps 7.2.17 Reset Parameters If the operator wants to reset the satellite name, enter \\u2018RESET PARAMETERS\\u2019 and select the \\u2018SAT ID RESET: YES Then, all the satellite names will be reset to \\u2018SAT0\\u2019.

ACU Power ON 2. Supply Power to Antenna 3. ACU Initializing 4. Bluetooth Connection 5. Step Motor Initializing 6. Search the Home Index 7. Search and Track the Satellite 1. The operator turns power on using the power switch on the front panel of the ACU. 2. The ACU supplies power (48VDC) to the antenna via the RX cable. 3. The ACU initializes. 4. Bluetooth of the ACU searches the Bluetooth of the PCU. A software version of the ACU and PCU is displayed on the ACU LCD panel when the Bluetooth connection succeeds. 5. Step motor (Sensor cage) initializes to level off the sensor cage. 6. The antenna rotates until the hall sensor searches the home index. 7. The antenna starts searching and tracking. Table 8-1 Antenna Operation Procedure \\u00be 1st: The RX power supply provides 48VDC to the ACU\\u2019s main board when the 99 operator turns the ACU power on. \\u00be 2nd: The ACU\\u2019s main board supplies 48VDC to the antenna via the BD-MUX and RX cable. \\u00be 3rd: The ACU checks the DC line during initializing. \\u00be 4th: The Bluetooth of the ACU searches the pre-paired Bluetooth of the PCU, and the ACU then displays the software version on the LCD panel of the ACU. \\u00be 5th: Firstly, the sensor cage rotates counterclockwise until it pushes the limit switch. Then, the sensor cage rotates clockwise to level off. \\u00be 6th: The Z12Mk2 uses the magnet as a home index of the antenna. After the initializing of the sensor cage, the azimuth axis of the antenna rotates to search for the magnet. The antenna stops the rotation when the hall sensor meets the magnet. NOTE: We named the 5th~6th steps \\u201cantenna initializing\\u201d. \\u00be 7th: The antenna will start searching for the satellite after the initializing. 8.2 Check Antenna\\u2019s Operational Status 8.2.1 Antenna Status The Z12Mk2 has 3 or 4 statuses in accordance with searching reference, as given below. The operator can see the state on the ACU LCD panel. INIT(Initializing): The antenna is initializing. SCH1(1st searching): The antenna searches for the target satellite signal. SCH2(2nd searching): The antenna searches for the highest target satellite signal. Only the searching reference is \\u2018DVB Carrier Lock\\u2019 and \\u2018EXT LOCK\\u2019. TRCK(Tracking): The antenna tracks the target satellite signal. 100 Figure 8-1 Antenna Status NOTE: means that the RX signal is unstable. The operator can see when the antenna is in initializing or searching or when the antenna is in blockage. 8.2.2 Signal Strength The operator can check the signal strength of the target satellite on the LCD panel of the ACU, as shown below in Figure 8-2. This signal strength is changeable by tracking reference. If you select the \\u2018DVB AGC\\u2019, you can see the DVB AGC level. (But the \\u2018AGC\\u2019 character remains unchanged.) Signal Strength KA-160 Figure 8-2 Signal Strength 8.2.3 Antenna Status LED The operator can check the status of the antenna using the LED on front panel of the ACU. The ACU has 3 LEDs: TRACK, GPS, and ERROR LED State Meaning TRCK Antenna is in initializing. Blink Antenna searches for the satellite.

Please refer to error index. Table 8-2 Meaning of Status LED Figure 8-3 Status LED 8.2.4 M&C using Mini USB The operator can connect the PC with the ACU using the mini-UBS port on the front panel of the ACU. The functions of the mini-USB port and the M&C port on the back panel of the ACU are the same. Mini USB Port for M&C Figure 8-2 M&C Port using Mini-USB 102 9. Troubleshooting It is important that the operator recognizes symptoms correctly and searches for broken parts, as KNS or the installer will then be able to cope with a problem more rapidly. This section concerns symptoms indicating breakage and offers a list of points for checking for those symptoms. There may be many checkpoints for one symptom, so you must follow the checkpoint steps. If your problem is solved in the 1st step, there is no need to follow the subsequent steps: Otherwise, you will have to go to the next step. Symptom #1 ACU does not turn on following ACU power on. Check Point 1. Make sure that the AC power cabling is connected between the ACU and the AC connector. 2. Check the output power (48VDC) of the RX power supply. 3.
